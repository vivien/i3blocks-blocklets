You may want to take a look at the individual blocklet directories, which contain descriptions, screenshots, and installation/configuration instructions.

NOTE: configurations reference `$SCRIPT_DIR`, meaning the directory that you put the script into. +
You must change `$SCRIPT_DIR` appropriately to coincide with where you put your scripts, for more info see the link:https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks-contrib/wiki/FAQ#blocklets-refer-to-script_dir-what-does-that-mean-how-can-i-use-it[FAQ].

Great!
Check the link:https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks-contrib/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md[contribution guidelines] in order to get started.

NOTE: i3blocks now supports dynamics properties, and all scripts have been updated to do the same. +
i3blocks-contrib requires a version of i3blocks that supports dynamics properties, so upgrade as necessary.

Happy crafting!
